brendon eich made mocha and then made javascript.
operators: 
arithmetic opertors: 
comparsion opertors:
In js == is === because ("2" == 2) it convert string in number by default.
== not strict.
=== strict.
arr[-23] = 12;
let arr= new Array(1000); this is blanck;
to fill it use [arr.fill(any value)] with a same value

push pop shift unshift; learn it. -- basically these all creating the new blanck array.
push() = add one or more element at the end of an array;
Returns: the new length of the array; 
pop() = remove only one element at the end of an array;
Returns: the removed element;
shift() = remove the first element of the array;
Returns: the removed element;
unshift() = add one or more elements at the beginning of the array. 
Returns: the new length of the array;
arr.forEach(function(val,index){body here})

let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
let ans = arr.map(function(val){
    return val+4;
})

arr.filter - which help to use the conditionals 
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
let ans = arr.filter((val){
    return val>4;
})

arr.splice(index,value); - this remove the number  on the array;
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
arr.splice(2,4);

arr.forEach(function (value){
    body;
})

reduce = to calculate and gives the one value
let arr = [1,2,34,5,55]
let ans = arr.reduce(dunction(acc,val){
    return acc+val
}, 0);

include = this give easily true or false value by checking in array;
let arr = [2, 34,5,45,8,5];
arr.include(34);

objects:
in object there are two things property and value; - poperty write with colon and value end with comma;
object creation and access;
let arr = {
    name : suraj,
    age: 19,
    number: 9038
}
ofject Methods;
object ke ander function ko method kahte hai;
let arr = {
    name : suraj,
    age: 19,
    number: function()
}
